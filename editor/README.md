License
-------
Unlike the rock3d.js library itself (which uses the permissive zlib license),
this editor is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0][1].
Because of the nature of this program, I don't forsee the license being any
more onerous than use of a GPL program.  However, if you have a specific use
case that you're afraid might run afoul of the license, please open an issue.
