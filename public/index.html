        <h1>rock3d.js</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            A 3D game engine with a retro heart.  You can find the github project <a href="https://github.com/AlexMax/rock3d.js">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p>
            You can test the current state of the client <a href="/client">here</a>.  Note that this relies on a functioning game server, which may or may not be up and running as of this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently you can join the server, run around with physics and collision, activate a lift, and observe other players running around the server.  As of this moment, you need a keyboard and mouse to play - touchscreen support is not yet implemented.
        </p>

            <tr><th colspan="2">Ingame controls</th></tr>
            <tr><td>W</td><td>Walk Forwards</td></tr>
            <tr><td>S</td><td>Walk Backwards</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Escape</td><td>Main Menu</td></tr>
        </table>
        <h2>Demo Player</h2>
        <p>
            If you have a demo from the client, you can play it back <a href="/client/demoIndex.html">here</a>.  This is intended as a debugging tool and no help is provided at this moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Editor</h2>
        <p>
            You can test the current state of the editor <a href="/editor">here</a>.  This editor exists 100% in your browser and has no hidden servers that it relies on (other than the assets, but if you can see this website you can download assets), but isn't actually fully functional as an editor right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can open the test map by clicking on "File" and then "Open".  Upon opening, you are thrust into the 2D drawing mode, but there is also a 3D visual view available, which can be toggled between using the View menu.  You need a keyboard and mouse to use this editor, as it was designed to be used on a computer.
