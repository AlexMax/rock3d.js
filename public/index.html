        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            A 3D game engine with a retro heart.  You can find the github project <a href="https://github.com/AlexMax/rock3d.js">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Test Client</h2>
        <p>
            You can test the current state of the client <a href="/client.html">here</a>.  Note that this relies on a functioning game server, which may or may not be up and running as of this moment.  Currently nothing much works that is user-visible, you are spawned at the start of a level and your inputs are sent to the server but there are no physics yet.
        </p>
        <h2>Test Editor</h2>
        <p>
            You can test the current state of the editor <a href="/editor.html">here</a>.  This editor exists 100% in your browser and has no hidden servers that it relies on, but isn't actually fully functional as an editor right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can open the test map by clicking on "File" and then "Open".  Upon opening, you are thrust into the 2D drawing mode, but there is also a 3D visual view available, which can be toggled between using the View menu.  You need a keyboard and mouse to use this editor, as it was designed to be used on a computer.
